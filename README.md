# IP Null Route

Perl IP Null Route Generator for use with firewalls and network appliances. Uses
ip lists updated daily from [IPDeny.com](http://www.ipdeny.com). These scripts
can be used to create IP Null Route (Blackhole) instructions sets that can be
run via the command line. You can also create cleanup instructions that will
delete the rules that have been created.

Code for these scripts started via a fork of a [perl script](https://github.com/rhicks/filtermaker.pl) by [Richard Hicks](https://github.com/rhicks)
